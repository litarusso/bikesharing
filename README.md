## Summary
This data show high activity of the bike sharing service (CityBikes) in NYC during the month of August 2019.
### Checkout Times
I created a slide with two plots about Checkout Times. The first plot is "Checkout Times for Users," and the second is "Checkout Times by Gender."
As I thought it will be usefull to see the users for 2 hours or less, I filtered them for 0, 1 and 2 hours. However, if they want deep down, they can select more from the filter box.

### Trips by Gender
In this slide of the story, we can see the usage of city bikes in New York City in August 2019. Furthermore, we see that men are using city bikes more than women. In that case, the company could promote to encourage women to use them more.
Also, we see that subscribers are more loyal to CityBikes than customers.
